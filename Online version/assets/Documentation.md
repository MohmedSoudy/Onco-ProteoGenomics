# Description

Tumor genomes are becoming increasingly complicated, but how they are controlled into functional proteomes is still a mystery.
The distinctiveness of the cancer transcriptome, with its point mutations, odd splice variants, and gene fusions, is not captured by standard proteomics procedures,
which rely on databases of known proteins. To detect tumor-specific peptides, onco-proteogenomics combines mass spectrometry data with genomic information.
The ability to link tumor-derived DNA, RNA, and protein measurements into a central-dogma perspective should help us better understand cancer biology.

# Main Functions

- **Search Spectral files using X!Tandem Search Engine**

- **Iterative search for multiple databases**

- **Handy data visualization for results**

# Contribution Guidelines

For bugs and suggestions, the most effective way is by raising an issue on the github issue tracker. Github allows you to classify your issues so that we know if it is a bug report, feature request or feedback to the authors.
