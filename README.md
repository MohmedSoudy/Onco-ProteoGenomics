# Onco-ProteoGenomics
Combining Multi-Omics for optimization and finding novel peptides in cancer diseases 

### Introduction 
LC/MS is a hyphenated technique, which combines the separating power of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), with the detection power of mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry is a wide-ranging analytical technique, which involves the production and subsequent separation and identification of charged species.

### Step one 
The curation and combination of mutated database related to cancer 

### Step two 
Build the proteomics pipeline to search spectral files against databases
